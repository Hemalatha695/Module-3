# Strings-Palindrome Check in Python (Without Built-in Functions)

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to check whether the string `"google"` is a **palindrome** or not, without using built-in palindrome checking functions.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Assign the string `"google"` to a variable.
2. Reverse the string manually using slicing (`[::-1]`).
3. Compare the original string with the reversed string.
   - If they are equal, print that the string is a palindrome.
   - Otherwise, print that it is not a palindrome.
4. Execute the program.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
Add code here
```
# Step 1: Assign the string to a variable
word = "google"

# Step 2: Reverse the string manually using slicing
reversed_word = word[::-1]

# Step 3: Compare the original and reversed strings
if word == reversed_word:
    print(f'"{word}" is a palindrome.')
else:
    print(f'"{word}" is not a palindrome.')
```
## Output
```
"google" is not a palindrome.
```
## Result
The program correctly checks and reports whether "google" is a palindrome by reversing the string manually
