# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
Add code here
```
# Step 1: Define a tuple with some letters and numbers
x = ('a', 'b', 'n', 5, 8, 'z')

# Step 2 & 3: Check if 'n' and 8 exist in the tuple using 'in' operator
check_n = 'n' in x
check_8 = 8 in x

# Step 4: Print the results
print("Does 'n
```

## Result
This program correctly uses the in operator to check for the presence of both a string and a number in a tuple.
